class HiddenMarkovModel:
    '''
    Class implementation of Hidden Markov Models.

    def __init__(self, A, O):
        '''
        Initializes an HMM. Assumes the following:
            - States and observations are integers starting from 0. 
            - There is a start state (see notes on A_start below). There
              is no integer associated with the start state, only
              probabilities in the vector A_start.
            - There is no end state. 

        Arguments:
            A:          Transition matrix with dimensions L x L.
                        The (i, j)^th element is the probability of
                        transitioning from state i to state j. Note that
                        this does not include the starting probabilities.

            O:          Observation matrix with dimensions L x D.
                        The (i, j)^th element is the probability of
                        emitting observation j given state i.

        Parameters:
            L:          Number of states.

            D:          Number of observations.
            
            A:          The transition matrix.
            
            O:          The observation matrix.
            
            A_start:    Starting transition probabilities. The i^th element
                        is the probability of transitioning from the start
                        state to state i. For simplicity, we assume that
                        this distribution is uniform.

    Helper function to train an unsupervised HMM. The function determines the
    number of unique observations in the given data, initializes
    the transition and observation matrices, creates the HMM, and then runs
    the training function for unsupervised learing.

    Arguments:
        X:          A dataset consisting of input sequences in the form
                    of lists of variable length, consisting of integers 
                    ranging from 0 to D - 1. In other words, a list of lists.

        n_states:   Number of hidden states to use in training.
